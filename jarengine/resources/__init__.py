# JarEngine - Python Game Engine Wrapper (PyGame-based)
# =============================================================================
#
# JarEngine is a lightweight game framework built on top of PyGame
# that simplifies usage while providing higher-level abstractions for
# game development and prototyping.
#
# =============================================================================
# Version: jarengine-v1.7
# Author: Jarjarbin Studio
# Licence: GPL v3
# =============================================================================
#
# This engine is inspired by PyGame, modern game engine design patterns,
# and directly influenced by the architecture of NewCSFML.
#
# It is designed for educational purposes and small-to-medium game projects.
#
# It provides structured systems such as entity management, scene handling,
# render abstraction, and advanced modules like particle systems.
#

# WARNING:
# =============================================================================
#
# This is NOT PyGame itself.
# It is a custom abstraction layer built on top of PyGame.
